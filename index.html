                <p>
                    I'm a creative mind hailing from the sunny landscapes of Southern California, now embracing the innovative nature of the Bay Area. My journey in the creative world began at Cal State East Bay, where I earned my BFA in Animation. This chapter allowed me to learn not just the art of bringing characters to life, but also the profound impact of narrative and visuals in digital media. With the ever-evolving world of technology, I found myself drawn to the possibilities of wed development and how my creative assets could be used in this new space. As a result, I enrolled in the Uc Berkeley Coding Bootcamp with the intention of expanding my skills in this digital space.

                    I'm on a quest to blend the imaginative storytelling of animation with the structural beauty of web development. Whether it's creating captivating user experiences or crafting websites that tell a story, I believe in the power of merging creativity with technology to leave a lasting impact. As I navigate through this journey, I'm eager to collaborate, learn, and grow in the field of web development. Let's connect and create something memorable together.
